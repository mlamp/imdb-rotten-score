**Discontinued as Rottentomatoes disabled API keys for unofficial projects**

From their page: _Please note that at this time we no longer support unauthorized use of our data (e.g. unofficial projects, non-user facing data integrations)._

IMDB will show rotten tomatoes score :) Go fetch API key at http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/ and put it to extension options window. If you are trying to load extension w/o installing, you need to change extension id in contentStyle.css.
